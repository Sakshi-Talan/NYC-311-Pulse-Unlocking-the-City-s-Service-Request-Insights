# NYC-311-Pulse-Unlocking-the-City-s-Service-Request-Insights

Welcome to NYC 311 Pulse, a data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on uncovering insights from New York City's 311 service requests. This project aims to clean, analyze, and visualize a large dataset of 311 complaints to identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can help improve city services and response times.

The dataset contains over 300,000 entries with 53 columns, including details such as complaint types, boroughs, creation and closure dates, response times, and geographic locations. Through this project, we clean the data, handle missing and duplicate values, standardize text and date formats, and perform in-depth exploratory analysis to answer key questions:

What are the most common types of complaints in NYC?
Which boroughs have the highest number of complaints?
How do complaints vary by time of day, day of the week, or month?
What is the distribution of response times for resolving complaints?
This project is a comprehensive example of how data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization can be used to derive meaningful insights from real-world datasets. The final cleaned dataset and visualizations are saved for further analysis or reporting.

Key Features

Data Cleaning:
Handling missing and duplicate values.
Standardizing text columns (e.g., converting to lowercase).
Converting date-time columns to the correct format.
Removing irrelevant or empty columns.
Data Manipulation:
Extracting time-based features (e.g., year, month, day, hour, day of the week).
Grouping complaints into broader categories (e.g., "Noise", "Parking").
Calculating response times for each complaint.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Complaints by Borough: Visualizing the distribution of complaints across NYC boroughs.
Top 10 Most Common Complaints: Identifying the most frequent complaint types.
Trends Over Time: Analyzing monthly and hourly trends in complaints.
Complaints by Day of the Week: Understanding how complaints vary by day.
Response Time Distribution: Visualizing the time taken to resolve complaints.
Visualizations:
Bar plots, line plots, and heatmaps to showcase trends and patterns.
Interactive and informative visualizations to make the data accessible.
Saving Cleaned Data:
The cleaned dataset, along with new features, is saved to a CSV file for future use.
Insights and Recommendations

Through this analysis, we uncovered several key insights:

Brooklyn has the highest number of complaints, followed by Manhattan and Queens.
The most common complaints are Blocked Driveway, Illegal Parking, and Noise - Street/Sidewalk.
Complaints peak during the evening hours (6 PM to 10 PM) and on weekends.
Most complaints are resolved within 24 hours, but some take significantly longer, indicating potential inefficiencies.
Based on these insights, we provide actionable recommendations, such as:

Allocating more resources to high-complaint boroughs.
Targeting interventions for the most common complaints.
Improving response times for delayed complaints.
Preparing for seasonal spikes in complaints.
